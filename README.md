# OSTIA
OSTIA is a parser to elicit and represent Storm Topologies by reverse engineering of Storm-based Big-Data programs. The intent and aim of OSTIA is to automatically represent models of Storm topologies and conduct inference analysis on them before nasty issues at run-time take place. A part of said run-time issues can be avoided by using OSTIA and the analyses intended within it.
