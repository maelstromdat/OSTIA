% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:

% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and

% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:

\begin{abstract}
Big data architectures have been gaining momentum in recent years. For
instance, Twitter uses stream processing frameworks like Storm to analyse billions of tweets per minute and learn the trending topics. However, architectures that process big data involve many different components interconnected via semantically different connectors making it a difficult task for software architects to refactor the initial designs. As an aid to designers and developers, we developed OSTIA that stands for ``On-the-fly Static Topology Inference Analysis"; OSTIA is a tool that allows: (a) recovering big data architectures for the purpose of design-time refactoring while maintaining constraints that would only be evaluated at later stages (deployment, run-time); (b) detecting the occurrence of common anti-patterns across big data architectures; (c) exploiting software verification techniques to evaluate the safety of the elicited architectural models. This paper illustrates OSTIA and evaluates its uses and benefits using industrial and open-source case study research.

\section{Terminological Reflections on Continuous Architecting}

With respect to the typical definition of software architectures, namely, \emph{[...] a set of interconnected and inter-communicating components across a series of connectors and other architecture elements} \cite{kazmanbook}, data-intensive application topologies are not properly \emph{software architectures}. Rather, DIA topologies are graphs of operations to be applied on raw big data. However, for the sake of designing their data-intensive applications, data-intensive architects need to use those topologies as subjects of the same rigorous architecting principles, practices, analyses and trade-offs inherited from software architecture research and practice. Much in the same vein, in designing OSTIA, we inherited tools, practices and approaches from software architecture recovery \cite{DobricaN02} to enable DIA topology reverse-engineering. This parallel between software architectures and data-intensive topologies is reasonable for two reasons.

On one hand, DIA topologies bear the same weight on overall DIA performance and application properties since they contain the architecture decisions (e.g., DIA middleware interconnections and dependencies) and middleware configurations (e.g., memory footprint, resource management, scheduling policies, degrees of parallelism) that dictate the visible DIA architecture properties. 

On the other hand, multiple middleware with different topologies may be merged within the same DIA --  in this instance it is in fact the combination of several topologies, typically one per each data-processing middleware, that dictates visible DIA architecture properties. 

As a result in the scope of OSTIA, the tool recovers *all distinct topology graphs* for supported technologies (Apache Hadoop and Apache Storm) that it finds in the namespace provided as input.

With this premise, \emph{we advocate that an analogy exists between the classical notion of software architecture and our notion of DIA topology, and, for this reason from now on we use the terms topology and architecture interchangeably.}

Under the above premise, we aim to support DIA \emph{*continuous*} architecting; In the big data domain, such continuous architecting means supporting the continuous and incremental improvement of big data topologies - e.g., according to the following iterative process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item changing the topological arrangement of data-processing elements in the topology, as well as tuning any of their properties (e.g., replication and parallelisation factors);
\item changing the data-intensive middleware configuration parameters (e.g., queues and their lengths);
\item using on-the-fly analyses on running applications (e.g., queue safety given a certain workload); 
\item exploiting platform and infrastructure monitoring data -- for example, the industrial partner that aided the evaluation of the results in this paper is currently facing the issue of continuously changing and re-arranging their stream processing application in response to: (a) types of content that need analysis (multimedia images, audios as opposed to news articles and text); (b) types of users that need recommendation (e.g., governments as opposed to single users); 
\item evaluate results and improvements, iterating back to step 1, if and where necessary;
\end{enumerate}

With OSTIA, we aimed at providing automated support to the above continuous architecting exercise in the scope of data-intensive architectures. OSTIA supports the (re-)design steps 1 to 3 with algorithmic manipulation, heuristics, and design anti-pattern matching; also, the tool supports step 5 with formal verification techniques.
