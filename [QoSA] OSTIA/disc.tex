\subsection{Findings and Quality-Improvement Insights}
\begin{itemize}
\item we should probably enumerate the many issues we have found with the work in WP2 and WP3 to allow some good insights for the people using OSTIA
\item also we could discuss the benefits one by one using some usage-scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approach Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\begin{itemize}
\item here we could elaborate on the limitations of addressing only storm and why we are addressing storm (e.g., the main technology for streaming currently)
\item we should probably discuss the fact that the tech is still eclipse-based and how this is not really a limitation after all
\item are there any threats to validity? we should probably discuss this as well
\end{itemize}
