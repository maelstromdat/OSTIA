\textbf{@Marcello,Francesco: we should also probably elaborate on the kind of verification technique we are using and how that can help in evaluating the topology.. remember here we do not have the DICE restriction so we can mention any kind of analysis that it would be possible to run, also analyses that are currently in the hands of other DICE partners!!}

\begin{itemize}
\item we can use the ATC case study as much as we want - that yields already three topologies that we can infer
\item ATC has agreed that we can mention their role in this exercise, I also showed them the topology that we elicited basically with OSTIA and they already made considerations on how to improve it
\item in the evaluation we should also comment on how OSTIA can help you in visualizing the application topology that you may be considering to use by reusing a big-data application for something else... visualising the application topology and analysing it may allow you to improve it while you are using it as a starting point for your application
\item another application that we can use is the one that NETF is considering for their own scenario, KILLRWEATHER - \url{https://github.com/killrweather/killrweather}
\item any additional case that we can run?
\item what do the results show? do we have a way to quickly quantify the time that is saved by using this approach? e.g., the time that is saved in setting up and running the infrastructure and how much would that time saved have costed these could be valuable evaluation insights
\end{itemize}
