\begin{itemize}
\item we can use the ATC case study as much as we want - that yields already three topologies that we can infer
\item any additional case that we can run?
\item what do the results show? do we have a way to quickly quantify the time that is saved by using this approach? e.g., the time that is saved in setting up and running the infrastructure and how much would that time saved have costed these could be valuable evaluation insights
\end{itemize}
