\begin{itemize}
\item I would follow the path of the abstract, we should probably provide some numbers and info on storm
\item mind you we should stress on the innovative aspects of the paper and tech. there is nothing strictly related to it
\item we should comment on what could be done with OSTIA in combination with Eclipse Based tech.
