%\begin{itemize}
%\item so we had a focus group to actually elaborate the aprroach 
%\item then we used explorative prototyping to elicit the initial version of the prototype and then refined that by means of case study, we could mention that we used ATC as an action-research source (this is what we are doing now internally in WP2 actually)

The work we elaborated in this paper is stemming from the following research question:

\begin{center}
\emph{``Can we improve the quality and effectiveness of deployable Big-Data streaming designs?"}
\end{center}

The material contained in this paper in response to this research question was initially elaborated within a free-form focus group \cite{fg} involving two experienced practitioners and researchers on streaming technology such as Storm. As a result of the focus group, through self-ethnography \cite{selfeth} and brainstorming we designed OSTIA and identified the series of consistency checks that could be run while recovering an architectural representation for Storm topologies. The prototype thus developed was refined incrementally through a series of case-studies. Finally, we applied well established verification approaches to integrate the value perceivable for OSTIA with established benefits stemming form the verification and validation field.\\
\textbf{TODO: @anyone, feel free to elaborate more!!}
