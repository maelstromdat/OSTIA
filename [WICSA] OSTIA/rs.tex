%% \textbf{@Pooyan,Andrea: here we should probably elaborate on OSTIA's architecture and the design principles that led us to define it as such... also we might want to elaborate on its components, the structure I'm suggesting below is merely tentative but it will give us ahead start!!}

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item add and comment the meta-model of storm and how OSTIA uses that as a reference to draw and check models which are consistent with the technology
%% \item OSTIA Architecture
%% \item we should probably elaborate the architecture part (or on a separate "implementation" part or paragraph) with a link to the downloadable technology - @Andrea: can we bundle it up as plugin for Eclipse? E.g., somehow using RCP?
%% \item OSTIA Antipatterns Module

\subsection{Storm architecture}

Storm is a technology developed at Twitter \cite{toshniwal2014storm} in order to
face the problem of processing of streaming of data. It is defined as a
distributed processing framework which is able to analyse streams of data. The
core element in the system is called \emph{topology}. A Storm topology is a
computational graph composed by nodes of two types: spouts and bolts. The former
type includes nodes that process the data entering the topology, for instance
querying APIs or retrieve information from a message broker, such as Apache
Kafka. The latter executes operations on data, such as filtering or serialising.

\subsection{OSTIA design}

The overall architecture of OSTIA is depicted in
Figure \ref{fig:ostia-arch}. The logical architectural information of the
topology is retrieved by OSTIA via static analysis of the source code. OSTIA
generates a simple intermediate format to be used by other algorithmic
processes.

OSTIA is architected in a way that algorithmic analysis, such as anti-pattern
analyses, can be easily added. These analyses use the information resides in the
intermediate format and provide added value analyses for continuous architecting
of storm topologies. Since the information in the intermediate format only rely
on the logical code analysis, some algorithmic analyses requires some
information regarding the running topology, such as end to end latency and
throughput.

Such information will be continuously added to the intermediate repository via
runtime monitoring of the topology on real deployment cluster. These provide
appropriate and rich information for refactoring the initial architecture and
enabling performance driven DevOps \cite{brunnert2015performance}.

Finally, OSTIA allows users to export the topology in different formats
(e.g. JSON) to analyse the topology with other tools.
